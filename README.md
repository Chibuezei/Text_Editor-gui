# Desktop_Calculator
We do calculations daily. You may need to know how much change you'll have after purchase or how many points your team needs to win the cup. A calculator can do the heavy lifting for us. In this project, I built a full-fledged calculator from scratch that can be run on your computer.

A project completed as part of the requirement for JetBrains Application Developer Certification.
